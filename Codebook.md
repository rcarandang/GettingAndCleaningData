===============================================

- body_acc_xyz_mean - The average body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration

- body_acc_xyz_sd - The std deviation of the body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- body_gyro_xyz_mean - The average angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

- body_gyro_xyz_sd - The std deviation of the angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

- total_acc_xyx_mean - The average acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. 

- total_acc_xyx_sd - The std deviation of the acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'.
